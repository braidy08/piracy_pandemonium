	"heist_piracy_pandemonium_lev_brief":"Okay, gang. I found a cool movie piracy website called MoviesFreeNoVirus.gov. It seems to be perfectly legitimate, so I'm taking you guys to an old, run down hotel so the police don't get suspicious. I had an inside man rent a room for the night and put a laptop with the site in our room, so all you guys have to worry about is steal some movies and getting out when you're done. Hopefully this job is easier than some of the others ones we did.",
