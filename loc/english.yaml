# Heist names

heist_piracy_pandemonium_nar_brief: "Alright, clowns. Hope you've brought some popcorn, cause this time we'll be doing some good ole' movie piracy. An inside man rented a run down hotel and put a laptop in there, so all you need to worry about is stealing movies. \n\n»Steal Movies \n»??? \n»Escape"
heist_piracy_pandemonium_nar_name: Piracy Pandemonium
heist_piracy_pandemonium_lev_brief: Okay, gang. I found a cool movie piracy website called MoviesFreeNoVirus.gov. It seems to be perfectly legitimate, so I'm taking  you guys to an old, run down hotel so the police don't get suspicious. I had an inside man rent a room for the night and put a laptop with the site in our room, so all you guys have to worry about is steal some movies and getting out when you're done. Hopefully this job is easier than some of the others ones we did.
