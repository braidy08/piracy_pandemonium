# Heist names

heist_piracy_pandemonium_nar_brief: "Alright, clowns. Hope you've brought some popcorn, cause this time we'll be doing some good ole' movie piracy. An inside man rented a run down hotel and put a laptop in there, so all you need to worry about is stealing movies. \n\n»Steal Movies \n»??? \n»Escape"
heist_piracy_pandemonium_nar_name: Piracy Pandemonium
heist_piracy_pandemonium_lev_name: The Apartments
heist_piracy_pandemonium_lev_brief: Okay, gang. I found a cool movie piracy website called MoviesFreeNoVirus.gov. It seems to be perfectly legitimate, so I'm taking  you guys to an old, run down hotel so the police don't get suspicious. I had an inside man rent a room for the night and put a laptop with the site in our room, so all you guys have to worry about is steal some movies and getting out when you're done. Hopefully this job is easier than some of the others ones we did.
heist_PP_ALTESCAPEDAY_name: The Streets
heist_PP_ALTESCAPEDAY_brief: Okay guys, good news and bad news. Good news, we've gotten a fair distance away from the crime scene. Bad news, the police put a tracker on the van and are catching up quicker than we could ever imagine escaping. We can distract 'em all we want, but there's no way we're leaving with the van. Thankfully Bile said he'd be happy to pick us up at a nearby building, but we'll have to delay the cops first. Don't worry about that, by the way. I've got a few tricks up my sleeves to deal with that.
heist_PP_UNLUCKYSURVIVAL_name: '???'
heist_PP_UNLUCKYSURVIVAL_brief: awh shit this wasnt apart of the plan spookers woah scary waaa waa waaa baby sounds.ogg NO help on objectives because you smell!!!!!!!!! (if you havent guessed this is temporary text)

# Alright, first things first, we need to get the police off of our tail before we hitch a ride from Bile. Lucky for us, there's a bridge nearby we can explode to slow down the cops. Don't worry about C4, I already supplied some in the back.
#
# picking up money
#
# Hey, listen, I know getting some cash may seem enticing, but as far as far as we're concerned, the police are a much bigger threat than some cash, and grabbing it only serves as a waste of time!
# Hey, leave the cash alone! I know it's ironic for me to get mad at grabbing some cash, but at the end of the day, we're wasting time we could be spending creating a distraction to get the cops off our ass, so why don't we focus on things that are actually important right now?
#
# saw gang
#
# Sheesh, looks like we're not the only ones trying to fighting through the police.
# Hot damn, they're in quite a pickle... maybe a distraction could help out these guys, too.
